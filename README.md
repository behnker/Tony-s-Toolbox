- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.css/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.
- **Backend & Database**: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
  - **App Hosting**: For deploying and hosting the Next.js application.
  - **Firestore**: As the NoSQL database for storing tool information.
  - **Cloud Storage**: For storing user-uploaded tool images.
- **AI Integration**: [Firebase Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit)
  - **Gemini API**: Used via Genkit to power AI flows for metadata generation.
- **Deployment**: [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build) for continuous integration and deployment, triggered by pushes to the `master` branch.

## Getting Started: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these instructions to get a complete local development environment running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/behnker/Tony-s-Toolbox.git
cd Tony-s-Toolbox
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Node.js packages using npm. It's recommended to use `npm ci` for clean and deterministic installs, especially in CI/CD environments.

```bash
npm ci
```

### 3. Initialize Firebase

To connect the project to your Firebase account and run the local emulators, you need to have the Firebase CLI installed and configured.

**A. Install the Firebase CLI:**
If you don't have it, install it globally:
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

**B. Log in to Firebase:**
```bash
firebase login
```

**C. Set up the Project:**
Run the `init` command. It will ask you a series of questions.
```bash
firebase init
```
When prompted, select the following options:
- **Project Setup**: Use an existing project (`ai-tool-explorer-txijl`).
- **Features to set up**:
  - `Firestore`
  - `App Hosting`
  - `Storage`
- **Emulators**:
  - `Authentication Emulator`
  - `Firestore Emulator`
  - `Storage Emulator`
  - `App Hosting Emulator`

Accept the default options for all other prompts (file names, port numbers, etc.). Do **not** overwrite any existing files (`firestore.rules`, `storage.rules`, etc.).

### 4. Run the Local Development Environment

This project uses the Firebase Emulators to simulate the entire backend locally.

To start both the Next.js application and all the Firebase emulators, run the following command:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

This will:
- Start the Next.js development server.
- Start the Firestore, Storage, and Auth emulators.
- Provide you with a link to the **Emulator UI**, a powerful dashboard for viewing and managing your local database and storage.
- Your application will be running at **`http://localhost:9005`**.

## Development Workflow

### Running Quality Checks

Before committing and pushing any code, it is essential to run the local quality checks. The automated deployment will **not** block a deployment for linting errors, so this responsibility is on the developer.

**A. Run the Linter:**
Checks for code style issues and potential bugs.
```bash
npm run lint
```

**B. Run the Type Checker:**
Checks for any TypeScript errors.
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

### Pushing and Deploying

The project is configured for **Continuous Deployment** using Google Cloud Build. Every push to the `master` branch will automatically trigger a new build and deployment process defined in `cloudbuild.yaml`. The build steps include:

1.  **Install dependencies**: `npm ci`
2.  **Run Linter**: `npm run lint`
3.  **Run Type Checker**: `npm run typecheck`
4.  **Build Next.js application**: `npm run build -- --no-lint`
5.  **Deploy to Firebase App Hosting**: `npm run firebase -- deploy --only=apphosting --project=ai-tool-explorer-txijl --non-interactive`

To deploy your changes:

1.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Describe your new feature or fix"
    ```

2.  **Push to the repository:**
    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

3.  **Monitor the deployment:** You can watch the build's progress in the [Google Cloud Build Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds?project=ai-tool-explorer-txijl). Once the build succeeds, the changes will be live.

## Strategy for Application Stability

To achieve a stable application and avoid continuous build failures, a robust strategy encompassing thorough testing, diligent debugging, and a structured development workflow is essential.

### Strategy: Comprehensive Local Validation and Proactive Quality Assurance

The core of this strategy is to identify and resolve issues as early as possible in the development cycle, primarily through extensive local testing and automated quality checks, before attempting any builds. This minimizes the risk of build failures caused by code issues or misconfigurations.

### Tactics:

1.  **Leverage Firebase Emulators for Local Development and End-to-End Testing:**
    *   **Description:** The project already utilizes Firebase Emulators, which provide a local simulation of your entire backend (Firestore, Storage, Auth). This is your most powerful tool for pre-build validation.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   Always start your development environment using `firebase emulators:start`. This command simultaneously launches your Next.js application and all Firebase emulators.
        *   Thoroughly test all application functionalities that interact with Firestore, Storage, and Authentication within this local environment. Verify data persistence, security rules, and user flows.
        *   Utilize the **Emulator UI** (typically accessible at `http://localhost:4000` after running the command) to inspect your local database, storage buckets, and authentication states. This provides invaluable visibility into your backend interactions.

2.  **Implement and Enforce Rigorous Local Quality Checks (Linting and Static Analysis):**
    *   **Description:** The `README.md` explicitly states that automated deployments will *not* block for linting errors. This makes local quality checks a critical responsibility for preventing issues from propagating.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   Before every commit, run your project's linting commands (e.g., `npm run lint` or `yarn lint` if configured).
        *   Address all reported linting errors and warnings immediately. Treat them as potential bugs or code smells that can lead to unexpected behavior or future problems.
        *   Consider integrating static analysis tools into your local pre-commit hooks to automate these checks and prevent non-compliant code from being committed.

3.  **Systematic Debugging Practices:**
    *   **Description:** When issues arise, having a systematic approach to debugging will save significant time and frustration.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   **Browser Developer Tools:** For frontend issues, use your browser's developer console to inspect elements, network requests, and console logs. Set breakpoints in your React/Next.js code to step through execution.
        *   **Logging:** Strategically place `console.log` statements (or a more robust logging library) throughout your backend and frontend code to trace the flow of data and identify where unexpected behavior originates.
        *   **Error Messages:** Pay close attention to error messages in both your terminal (from the Next.js server and Firebase emulators) and browser console. They often provide direct clues about the problem.

4.  **Version Control Best Practices with Feature Branches:**
    *   **Description:** A well-structured Git workflow can prevent breaking changes from impacting the main codebase and causing build failures.
    *   **Actionable Steps:**
        *   **Feature Branches:** Always develop new features or bug fixes on separate Git branches (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/issue-123`).
        *   **Regular Rebasing/Merging:** Keep your feature branches up-to-date with the main branch (`main` or `develop`) by regularly rebasing or merging to minimize merge conflicts.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Before merging any branch into your main development branch, conduct thorough code reviews with another team member. This helps catch logical errors, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to best practices.

5.  **Consider Pre-Release Testing Services (for future enhancements):**
    *   **Description:** While the immediate goal is a stable application, for a robust release process, consider integrating pre-release testing services as suggested by the Firebase documentation.
    *   **Actionable Steps (Future):**
        *   **Firebase Test Lab:** Once you have a stable local build, explore integrating Firebase Test Lab to test your application on a wider range of virtual and physical devices in the cloud.
        *   **Firebase App Distribution:** For human testing, use Firebase App Distribution to easily distribute pre-release builds to a group of trusted testers.

## Important Project Notes

### Genkit API Route Syntax

The Genkit API route at `src/app/api/genkit/route.ts` has been updated to use the latest syntax for the `@genkit-ai/next` library. The key takeaways are:
- The `nextJsHandler` function is a **default export**.
- The new API only supports **one flow per API route**.
- The handler expects the flow to be passed **directly as an argument**.

Correct implementation:
```typescript
import nextJsHandler from '@genkit-ai/next';
import { generateToolMetadataFlow } from '@/ai/flows/generate-tool-metadata';

const handler = nextJsHandler(generateToolMetadataFlow);

export const GET = handler;
export const POST = handler;
```

### CORS Configuration for File Uploads

If you encounter CORS errors when uploading files to Firebase Storage in a new environment, you will need to apply the CORS configuration.

1.  **Authenticate with the Google Cloud CLI:**
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login
    ```

2.  **Apply the configuration:**
    ```bash
    gcloud storage buckets update gs://[YOUR_BUCKET_ID] --cors-file=./cors.json
    ```
    (Replace `[YOUR_BUCKET_ID]` with your project's storage bucket ID, e.g., `ai-tool-explorer-txijl.appspot.com`).

### AI Assistant Integration (Firebase Studio IDX)

This project is actively supported by an AI assistant integrated within Firebase Studio IDX. The assistant has direct access to the project's files and the terminal, and will proactively assist with development tasks, debugging, and deployment.

**Important Commands for the AI Assistant:**

To ensure the AI assistant has the necessary permissions for deployment tasks, particularly for Firebase App Hosting, the following `gcloud` commands were executed and are crucial for future reference:

```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ai-tool-explorer-txijl \
  --member serviceAccount:380797253619@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/firebaseapphosting.admin
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ai-tool-explorer-txijl \
  --member serviceAccount:380797253619@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
  --role roles/editor
```

These commands grant the Cloud Build service account (`380797253619@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`) the `Firebase App Hosting Admin` role (`roles/firebaseapphosting.admin`) and the `Project Editor` role (`roles/editor`) for the project `ai-tool-explorer-txijl`.

As an AI assistant, I will always provide full `gcloud` and `firebase` commands within our chat for transparency and ease of execution.
